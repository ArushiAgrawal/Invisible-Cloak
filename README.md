# Harry Potter Invisible Cloak using OpenCV

The technique works as follows: 
1. Capture and store the background frame
2. Detect the desired color using color detection and segmentation algorithm
3. Segment out the colored part by generating a mask
4. Replace the color with the mask in each frame
5. Display the final output 


Have fun!
